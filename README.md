📂 Repository Structure
Scaling Techniques Explored
Min-Max Scaling: Rescales features to a fixed range (e.g., 0 to 1).
Standardization: Centers data by subtracting the mean and scaling to unit variance.
Robust Scaling: Handles outliers by using the median and interquartile range.
Others: Covers advanced scaling methods for specific use cases.
Comparison and Analysis
Visualizations: Plots and charts illustrate the impact of scaling on data distributions.
Model Performance: Analyze how scaling affects machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and k-NN.
